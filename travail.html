                    French is arguably one of the most pleasant languages to the ear but it can also sound complex, expansive and rich. With its complexities, you can still arrive at an advance level even as a beginner currently. 
                    French with <strong>‘Verichima’</strong>has been established to train and educate Pupils, Students, Professionals, Clergies, Business owners and Company Managers on French language and Culture online.

                        This is the most basic level that would highlight your first knowledge of the French Language. You are expected to interact in the simplest way possible by learning to speak about your self and your immediate environment.

However, you will be taught to understand and express complex topic and ideas.

                        At this stage you might think you have come so far to attend classes. Unfortunately, it is common for learners to get stuck because more emphasis on targeted and strategic multi-layered learning is needed to tighten up weak spots.

                        My son spent only three months learning French at 'French with Verichima'. Even online, the staff are lovely and the atmosphere is always welcoming. In the Discovery Program, he spent his mornings immersing in French and engaging in learning activities. He has met many new friends through the online classes, and I am happy that he is now conversing confidently in French.

                        I’m overdue in thanking you for all your assistance as we looked into creating time for our other two children to attend your physical class. Mia and Noah had a terrific time and learned so much. The afternoon activities exceeded expectations and they are still in touch with friends they met that week. The private lessons really helped Mia out with the subjunctive— on her first day of school, she passed the test needed to jump ahead a year of honors French.
